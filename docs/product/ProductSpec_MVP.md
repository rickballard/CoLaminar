# Product Spec — MVP

## Goals
- Hide dopamine hooks on YouTube web (Shorts/home/related/comments).  
- Render a "Clean Feed" from policy + OPML.  
- Compute Focus/Growth grades from viewing.  
- Apply API actions with consent (subscribe/unsubscribe; playlist add).

## Non‑Goals
- Modifying native iOS apps.  Stealth automation.  Password capture.

## User Stories
1) As a parent, I toggle Kid Mode and import a starter whitelist.  The home feed and Shorts vanish; my child sees a "Daily Learn" queue.  
2) As a learner, I set "counterpoint required" for news and see contrasting sources side‑by‑side.  
3) As a parent, I get a weekly Focus/Growth summary.

## Acceptance
- Shorts/home/comments hidden on YouTube web.  
- Clean Feed lists 20 items from OPML within 2s.  
- Focus/Growth update live as I watch.  
- OAuth flow for YouTube succeeds and can create a "Daily Learn" playlist with one tap.
