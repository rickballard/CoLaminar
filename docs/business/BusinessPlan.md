# Business Plan — CoLaminar (v1, 2025-08-23)

## 1. Mission
Protect attention and grow minds.  Replace engagement‑first feeds with a **learning‑first companion** that parents and self‑learners control.  Transparent, privacy‑first, donation‑supported.

## 2. Problem
Default recommenders optimize for watch time and outrage.  Families lack simple, cross‑device tools that (a) block dopamine hooks, (b) curate from trusted sources, (c) respect platform rules, and (d) provide **evidence** of healthier use.

## 3. Solution
A companion that:
- Hides Shorts/home/related/comments on the web via extensions and Safari content blockers.  
- Curates a **Clean Feed** from **RSS + YouTube channel RSS** with a portable **policy JSON**.  
- Applies allowed changes via official APIs (subscriptions/playlists) with explicit user approval.  
- Computes **Focus** and **Growth** grades.  Kid Mode enforces ≥6‑minute videos and whitelists channels.

## 4. Product Pillars
- **Consent‑first.** Software proposes; the user approves.  
- **Open policy.** JSON, versioned, auditable, exportable.  
- **Compliant surfaces.** APIs, RSS, extensions, and Family controls.  No puppeteering.  
- **Local‑first.** No passwords.  Minimal data.  Logs stay on device by default.  
- **Ad‑free.** Donations and school pilots sustain development.

## 5. Users
- Parents of 7–14 year olds.  
- Lifelong learners who want high‑signal news + long‑form video.  
- Schools / libraries deploying managed iPads or Chromebooks.

## 6. Differentiation
- Positive selection (learning value), not just risk filtering.  
- Portable policy + OPML feeds.  
- **Metrics that matter** (Focus/Growth/Diversity) visible each week.  
- Strict compliance with platform and child‑privacy rules.

## 7. Go‑To‑Market
- **Phase A:** Browser extensions (Chrome/Edge/Firefox), PWA “Clean Feed.”  
- **Phase B:** iOS Safari content blocker + web‑extension; Android with browser extension.  
- **Phase C:** School pilots via MDM profiles; weekly class reports.

## 8. Community & Funding
- Open repo.  MIT license for scaffolding and docs.  
- Donations (Open Collective / GitHub Sponsors).  Optional school support contracts.  
- CoCivium alignment: consent‑first governance; exportable policies; community moderation paths.

## 9. Legal & Compliance (non‑exhaustive)
- COPPA‑style consent for Kid Mode.  
- Platform terms respected.  No scraping behind logins.  OAuth only.  
- Clear Privacy and Terms (drafts included).

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Store policy rejections.**  Mitigate by using official surfaces only.  
- **Perceived ineffectiveness versus “full control.”**  Educate users on benefits; show metrics gains.  
- **Donation fatigue.**  Keep costs low; provide school value.

## 11. KPIs
- % long‑form viewing (Focus).  
- Growth score per week.  
- Diversity index for news sources.  
- Kid Mode compliance streaks.  
- Weekly active households and retention.

## 12. Roadmap Summary
See `/docs/product/Roadmap.md` for milestones and acceptance criteria.
